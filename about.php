<h3>About This Site:</h3>
<p>
This site was made as a database for the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/aamprod/productsnaval">Axis & Allies Naval Miniatures</a> by Avalon Hill (part of Wizards of the Coast).  Their site has a database of their own, but not of the Naval Miniatures, so this was made to fill the void.

<p>
Thanks goes out to Dogan who helped me find all the cards, and those at the <a href="http://forumini.boards.net/">ForuMINI forums</a> and <a href="http://wargamingforums.com/2008/08/29/war-at-sea-picture-card-gallery/">CWF Game Cast</a> for providing scans of the cards, which made transcription possible. (As much as I'd love to own full sets of the releases, I don't. :))

All the information is displayed as close to the original as possible, except in a couple of cases:<br />
- In the case of an errata, the corrected information is shown and the original information is noted at the bottom. <br /> 
- With the change in display mechanics such as Flagship and Carrier information being stated as an ability is applied to all of the units.
